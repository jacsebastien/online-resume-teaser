# Online resume static
Static part of my new online resume project

## Technos
- HTML5
- CSS3 (SCSS)
- Node.js (for dependencies)

## Install
You need **Node.js** to install the project and to have acces to the dependencies.

Once it's done, run `npm i` inside the project.

## Run
The style part of the project is written in **SCSS**. You need a compiler to be able to run the website.

With **VSCode** you can simply use the **Live Sass Compiler** plugin that comes with **Live Server** plugin to have it working with live reload.
